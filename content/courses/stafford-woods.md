Stafford is regarded by many as the gem of South Jersey. The reason for its pristine look is due to thousands of hours put in the by dozens of volunteers over the last few years. It started as nine holes in 2012, and expanded to the full 18 by the following year.

The local crew is never happy with the status quo and thus raise the bar of expectations every year. Consistent and dedicated efforts have achieved paver tee pads on both long and short positions throughout. Stone benches have been erected on half the course. And the environment is saved by erosion control techniques that are both artistic and challenging (see the greens for Hole 6 and 15).

The history of Stafford grew in 2018 when it was host to the first ever PDGA A-Tier tournament to be held in New Jersey. The course never looked better and the touring professionals, including the reigning World Champion, were impressed.
