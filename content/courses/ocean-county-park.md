The key feature out here is the beauty of the property. OCP is built on the grounds of a former summer retreat estate of John D. Rockefeller. The holes provide picturesque views of the many meadow-like fairways. The disc golf challenge comes into play with the use of the wooded areas scattered
throughout.

OCP started as nine holes in 2013, then expanded to 18 soon after due to being popular. The local crew added paver tees in the following years to make it a joy to play. Again, a testament to the will and volunteerism of our players.

Great footage of the course was captured during our 2017 Cross-Town event which had attracted a few touring professionals. After a morning round at Doc Cramer, the second round was held at OCP.
