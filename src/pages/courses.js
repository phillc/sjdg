      <p>We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

      <p>Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.</p>

      <p>He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...</p>

      <p>The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.</p>

      <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

      <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>

      <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>

      <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Red Five standing by. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>

      <p>I'm trying not to, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>

      <p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>

      <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- You don't believe in the Force, do you? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>

      <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>

      <p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. As you wish. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>

      <p>You mean it controls your actions? You don't believe in the Force, do you? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>

      <p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. What!? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>

      <p>Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.</p>

      <p>All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!</p>

      <p>You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me.</p>

      <p>Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.</p>

      <p>Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.</p>
